This project was made as a hackathon project during Codecation 2024, which was a hackathon organised by Backtick Technologies in October of 2024 in Spain.
It was inspired by the well known computer game Factorio and was written in Rust using the Bevy game engine.

## Running the game

To run the game locally run `cargo run` at the root of the project.

The game can also run in WebAssembly. To generate the website run `task export-web`. It will create a folder called `out` which an be hosted like any other static site.

It might also be possible to play the game at https://factorito.fly.dev. This was at least possible at the end of the hackathon.
